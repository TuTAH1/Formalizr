Babkin (later the \"author\".)\nCopyright (C) 2014-2019.\n\nData Collection Policy\n==================================\nThe software employs collection of the data provided by the end-user during their interaction with web pages loaded into the web browser (Google Chrome), that complies with the software's main function, or the software motto, \"Remembers what you type, in case of a page crash.\" The data collected (later referred to as the \"data\") consists strictly of the following: a) Input text obtained from the keyboard and/or mouse drag-and-drop operations, or b) text pasted into web forms from the Clipboard, or c) text inserted into web forms automatically by scripts running on the page or by other web browser extensions.\n\nThe software will collect data ONLY from the following types of web pages, with: a) standard http URLs, and b) secure https URLs. Data from any other web pages, having a different URL protocols, will not be collected, including but not limited to: ftp and other protocols, as well as from other web browser extensions, and locally opened files.\n\nThe software does NOT collect the data from sources outside the web browser that hosts it (i.e. Google Chrome), including: a) other web browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.) or b) other running programs, or c) parts and components of the operating system itself.\n\nSensitive Data Collection Prevention\n==================================\nThe software will NOT attempt to collect any input from the password fields, although if such fields are mislabeled in the html markup on a page, the data may be collected from them as well. Since there's no reliable way to automate detection of the end-user's private and/or sensitive data, the end-user must be aware that some of their sensitive data, not specifically provided via password fields, may be inadvertently collected by the software, including but not limited to: credit card numbers, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, bank account numbers and other sensitive information that may be unintentionally picked up from the form fields as the end-user types it in. In such case the software provides the end-user with easy means to manually delete any collected sensitive data, as well as the means to prevent any further collection of data from specific web pages with the use of the \"URL Exceptions,\" as well as the ability to temporarily disable the software, and the ability to wipe out all collected data. It is assumed to be the responsibility of the end-user to track any inadvertent collection of the sensitive information by the software, as well as the proper manual disposal of such information by the end-user.\n\nData Storage Policy\n==================================\nBy default the data collected by the software will be stored in the local persistent storage where the software is installed and running. The configuration and settings of the Google Chrome web browser will determine the exact location of the file on the local physical disk where the data will be stored. The software by itself will NOT attempt to offload the collected data from the local storage where the software is installed and running. Note that in some circumstances, depending on the configuration of the operating system where the web browser hosting the software is installed, the file storing the data collected by the software may be uploaded to the end-user's offsite or \"cloud\" account, such as when the software is installed on the operating system supporting such feature or with the use of other software, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, One Drive, etc.; or a copy of the file storing the data collected by the software may be created and moved off the local computer by a backup software; or if the operating system where the software is running supports \"roaming user profiles,\" such configuration may allow the file storing data collected by the software to be shared between several physical machines. Note that the list of circumstances given above should not be considered as all-encompassing, as there may be other possibilities how the file storing the data collected by the software could be potentially offloaded from the local storage by means outside of the software's control. The software by itself WILL NOT attempt to offload your collected data. If such is important, it is the end-user's responsibility to prevent storage of the private and/or sensitive information collected by the software using the means outlined above.\n\nThe software provides means for the end-user to disable placement of the collected data in the persistent storage, i.e. into a file on the local physical disk. If such option is enabled, the software will only collect data in the system volatile memory (or RAM) that will be discarded as soon as the last web browser window hosting the software is closed. Note that in this case, it is also possible for a malicious software running alongside the web browser to extract the data collected by the software from the system RAM. If such is important, it is the end-user's responsibility to prevent storage of the private and/or sensitive information collected by the software using the means outlined above.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n==================================\nThe software will NOT attempt to offload, distribute, broadcast, sell or in any way use the collected data for the purpose other than providing means for the end-user to restore collected information upon their sole discretion. The software was designed with the privacy of the end-user's data in mind, i.e. it attempts to the best of the available capabilities of the programming language (i.e. JavaScript) to prevent offloading or \"spreading\" of the collected data from the local system where the software is installed and running.\n\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that the data collected by the software IS NOT stored in encrypted form!\n\nTo provide transparency, the authors of the software are agreeing to disclose any technical details about the structure of the programming code used to design the software. Make sure to submit your specific request at dennisbabkin.com/contact\n\nIncognito Browsing\n==================================\nBy default the software honors the \"incognito\" mode of the web browser by not storing in persistent storage or displaying the data collected during the incognito browsing. The software provides additional means for the end-user to disable data collection during the incognito browsing altogether, as well as a \"more relaxed\" option to allow data collection and storage of the collected data in the persistent storage upon the end-user's additional selection.\n\nSoftware Warranty & Support\n==================================\nThe software is supplied to you free of charge, without ANY expressed or implied warranties from the authors or distributors of the software. You install and use the software \"AS-IS,\" upon your sole discretion and judgment, fully aware of the conditions and limitations outlined herein. The technical support provided for the software is done so upon the author's free will and should not be considered an implied responsibility from the authors or distributors.\n\nRelease of Liability\n==================================\nBy using the software the END-USER AGREES TO RELEASE any responsibility from the authors or distributors of the software for the damages, or the loss or misuse of data that may be incurred by the software, including but not limited to the loss or exposure of the end-user's sensitive or private information. Guarding such information is assumed to be the sole responsibility of the end-user. It is also assumed that the end-user is fully aware of the limitations of the software outlined above.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE STATEMENTS & CONDITIONS LISTED ABOVE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. BY CONTINUING TO USE THE SOFTWARE YOU ISSUE YOUR FULL AGREEMENT WITH THE STATEMENTS OUTLINED IN THIS DOCUMENT.",
